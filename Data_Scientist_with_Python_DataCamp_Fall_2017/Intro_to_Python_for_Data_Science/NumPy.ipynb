    "List s are a great way to store information and are mutable but they are not ideal to performe calculations over a large number of values quickly, especially if different values are stored in different objects. This can be solved by using NumPy (Numeric Python) and the **NumPy Array**. It behaves similarly to a list but you can do calculations over an entire array quickly and efficiently. Simply install it with `pip3 install numpy`\n",

    "## Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "1) NumPy can do these calculations so easily because it assumes that the arrays contain values of **_the same type!_** If there are multiple types, the array method will try to convert every type to a single one, known as **type coercion**, so pay attention to the type of your inputs and the type of the final array. By the way, the `boolean` `True` and `False` are converted to `1` and `0`, respectively, when coerced to `int`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) An array is another kind of type in Python, which means that it comes with its own sets of methods. The methods will behave differently than in lists, e.g., if you sum two list you end up with a new list with all the values whereas if you sum up two arrays, python will add up the elements!\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Values in an array can be extracted with subsetting just like in list, i.e., with indices. However, arrays can also be subsetted using an array of `boolean` values. This can give you all the values that are, for example, greater than something, see below."
