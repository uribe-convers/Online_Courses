    "Functions are blocks of code that you can reuse many times by just calling the name of the function and not the whole code. You can write your own functions, use someone else's, or use the built-in function that Python comes with. You can assign the output of a function to a variable. Different functions have different numbers of required arguments and/or optional arguments. To know more about a specific function, you can type `help(function)` to get the manual; `help` is a built-in function too! The optional arguments are surrounded by square brackets in the documentations."

Finally, if you only need a specific function from a package, you can import only that function with `from package import function`, which allows you to simply type `function`. The last way of importing a function reduces the amount of coding but it's less specific because someone else using your code might not know where the function comes from."
