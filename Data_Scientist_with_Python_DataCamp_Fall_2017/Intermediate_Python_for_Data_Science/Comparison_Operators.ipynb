The `or` operator is similar but only one of the `boolean` has to be `True`. Finally, the `not` operator negates the `boolean` value that is used on.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Numpy things are a bit different. It works the same way for greater or less than operators, but not for `and`, `or`, and `not`. For those, you need the functions `numpy.logical_and()`, `numpy.logical_or`, and `numpy.logical_not`. The operation is done element-wise. To retrieve only the values that meet the `boolean` operator, you can subset using a `boolean` array."
