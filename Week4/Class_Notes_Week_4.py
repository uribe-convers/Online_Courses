# For Loops and Fancy String Manipulation
# Strings can be compared using operators.

animal = "cat"
animal == "cat"
animal != "cat"

# They can be compared using their order in the alphabet letter by letter
# >, <, >=, <=, all work
"abracadabra" < "ace"
"abracadabra" > "ace"

# Capitalization mattres! Capital lettres are less than lower case letters

"a" <= "A"
