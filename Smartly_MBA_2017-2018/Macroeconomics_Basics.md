# Macroeconomics : Basics

Macroeconomics is the study of national and international economies and markets. The main indicator forthe health of a country is its Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which is the total market value of goods and services of a country in one year.

GDP is useful to know about the whole economy but it doesn't tell us about particular individuals _within_ the economy.

## Inflation

Defined as the continued rise in the price level that last longer than a few months. The opposite is deflation. The price level is the average price for a _particular_ class of goods and services but not for a _specific_, e.g., jeans but not Levi's.

To calculate inflation, we need a price index, which is the average price for a set of goods and services, also called a "basket of goods". One of these is the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which deals with rent, health care, transportation, clothes... The more percent a category has within the set, the more expensive. You calculate the the price index by diving the current price by the base (previous price) and multiplying that by 100.

Inflation is calculated by: `((Current PI / Base PI) -1) * 100`.

Inflation is important to determine how the economy's **output** (what an economy produces) is changing. The output can be **nominal** (measured at current prices) or **real** (measured at inflation adjusted prices).

## Unemployment

To calculate unemployment, you divide the unemployed people by the labor force (everyone who can work, 16 years and older).

There are three main categories of unemployment:

1. Frictional  
	* You are unemployed while you search for a new job. This unemployment is "inevitable".
2. Cyclical   
	* This is one is related to the business cycle and not the employee. Think of recession.
3. Structural  
	* When the structure of the economy changes and some workers are not needed. Jobs become obsolete with technology.

### Okun's Law

There is a negative relationship between unemployment and GDP: when unemployment is high, the GDP is low.

## GDP

Can be considered as the size of an economy, how much is produced. To calculate the GDP, economist add the value of **_everything_** a country produces. However, the intermediary price of something that is sold later as a finish product is not computed, as it is considered that the intermediary price will be included in the final price. For example, the price of an raw orange is ignored and only the price of the prepared juice is added.

GDP is divided into:

1. Consumption  
	* Durable goods (house, cars), Nondurable goods (clothes, food), and Services (medical, car service)
2. Investment  
	* The simple reallocation of money doesn't count, the money has to grow. Buying a house is not but building a new house is because it grows 
3. Government purchases  
	* Military, infrastructure, government salary
4. Net exports  
	* Value of goods and services sold by a country other nations, minus how much they buy from other nations. More exports than imports gives a positive net export.

## Boom and Bust
This deal with the business cycles and there are four unique stages:  
1. Recession   
2. Recovery  
3. Growth  
4. Decline  


Another very important term is **Aggregated Demand (AD)**, which is the total amount of goods and service demanded in an economy. So if prices are high, AD is low and this is described as the wealth effect. If prices drop by half you feel wealthier!
