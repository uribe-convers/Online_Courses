# Microeconomics I: Supply and Demand

## Chapter 1

The limited resources of our planet are what economist study. Under these limitations, **economic resources** form the building blocks of an economy and can be separated into:

1. Human resources
2. Non-Human resources
	* Land, minerals, oil, technology  

There are always trade off because resources are scarce. Microeconomics is the study of how individuals, households, and firms make decision about _using_ the resources, not just buying and selling, or producing them. Microeconomics also wants to understand the collective behavior of individuals, households, and firms, which they call **economic units**.
The economic units are assumed to be _rational_ (always making the best choice) and always wanted to _maximize_ the gains. They will try to maximize even small amounts deriving what is called **marginal benefits**, or small incremental benefits.

## The demand curve

The **law of demand** states that, if everything else equal, the quantity demanded of a product will increase if the price falls and decrease if the price rises. This can be represented in a graph, the demand curve, where price is plotted against quantity. These curves are useful to compare multiple _demand schedules_. If multiple demand schedules are combined, you get the **market demand schedule**. Demand curves can shift from left to right or vice-versa depending if there is an increase or decrease in demand for that product for any reason, e.g., price increase, recession, etc.

## The supply curve
The **law of supply** says that, if everything else equal, when the market price for goods increases, the quantity that suppliers produce and sell will increase, and vice-versa. This gives a _supply schedule_ and can be plotted in a _supply curve_ with price against quantity. If you add the individual supply figures, you get the **market supply**. 

Upticks in the curve, from $x to $y, are called **movements along the supply curve**. However, this is different than a supply curve shift! The latter moves the whole curve towards th right or left depending on many factors, production price, salaries, rent, loans.

## Supply and demand

Price balances supply and demand and it acts as a motivator for consumers, with low prices demand increases and vice-versa. When the supply curve and the demand curve are plotted, which run in different directions, you can see where the market is at an **equilibrium** (the two curves intersect). The price at which this occurs is called the **equilibrium price** and the quantity at which this occurs is called the **equilibrium quantity**. When supply exceeds demand, there is a **surplus** of goods. The opposite is called a shortage, demand higher than supply.

After a shortage or surplus, the **law of supply and demand** states that prices will adjust to create equilibrium.

## Equilibrium shifts

There are events that can disrupt the market's equilibrium point. If the demand and/or supply curves shift, the the market's equilibrium will shift too. Some event will shift only one curve whereas some event will have an effect on both.

## Chapter 2

## Understanding consumer demand

People always pick the option that gives them the most satisfaction (happiness). Unit of satisfaction are called **utils**. The total number of utils can change depending on circumstances, and it's based on **marginal utility**, the gain from consuming _one more_ unit of a good. The marginal utility tends to decrease as the amount consumed increases, so much that it can become negative.

Consumers face four dilemmas:

1. Budget constraints 
2. These are define by income and prices of goods
3. These limit their choices
4. They have option how to spend their limited resources 

The availability of goods can change consumers decisions and the _substitute goods_. If one becomes too high, the consumer will pick the other. A _complementary good_ goes with the other good. For the complement goods, an increase on the price of one of the goods will decrease the demand for the other one. Finally, an _independent good_ isn't affected by another good.

Price elasticity of demand measures how demand changes in response to price. It's elastic if it changes greatly in response to prices changes, or inelastic if it changes slightly. Goods that are necessary (food, gas, cigarrettes) are inelastic, people will still buy them regarding of price. Luxury items or ones with many substitutes are elastic.

## Price elasticity of demand

You can calculate price elasticity demand (PED) with the following equation: `PED = % change in Q / % change in P`, where `Q` is quantity demanded and `P` is price. If `% change in Q` is greater than `% change in P`, the demand is elastic.

To calculate the `% change in Q` (or `% change in P`) we can use the **midpoint method**, which is Q2 minus Q1, divided by Q2 plus Q1 divided by 2 (dividing the change in Q by the _average_ of the two Q).   

Sometimes you'll get a negative value but we are interested in the absolute value.

```
				Q2 - Q1
% Change Q = --------------
				Q2 + Q1
     		 -------------	
     				2
```     					

With both the `% change~ of `Q` and `P`, you can calculate the PED value, which is the measure of elasticity between two precise price points. The values are small when there is inelasticity and high when they are elastic. When PED is 1, it is said that the movement between price points is **unit elastic**. Finally, **cross price elasticity of demand (CPED)** describes the effect a price change has over a substitute good, i.e., the demand for cookies when the price for cupcakes increases. This is calculated by dividing the % change of Q for good x by the % change of P for good y.

PED varies across markets, e.g., car usage in L.A. vs in NYC, and over time, e.g., gas in L.A. now vs electric cars in the future.

## Cost of production

A company must make a profit, which is the total revenue minus the costs. Costs are divided into **fixed** and **variable**, which either don't change or they do depending on how much the company manufactures. The production function is the relationship between the quantity of an _input_ (how many workers) with the _output_ (how much they can manufacture.) This is not linear, and the **marginal product** (increase in output with one more unit of input) can decrease, or there can be a **diminishing marginal product**. Some costs are shared regardless of how much is produced, and this is known as the **average fixed cost**, which decreases with more units being produced (rent is always the same but if you produce 100 instead of 10, it's divided by 100.)  

The main relationship is between **marginal cost** (cost of producing one more item) and **average total cost** (total cost divided by number of items.) If the marginal cost is higher than the average total cost, the average total cost will increase.

## Revenue, cost, and profits

You can calculate future revenue by using **marginal revenue**, which is the change of total revenue divided by the change of quantity. Diminishing marginal profit doesn't decrease total profits, but it does mean that there are less profits with each sale. **Maximizing profits** is achieved when marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost.
