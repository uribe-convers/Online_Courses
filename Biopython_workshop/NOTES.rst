As this material is aimed at Python beginners, we're avoiding a lot of
useful but not fundamental things, including:

* String formating with the % operator
* Exceptions and try/except error handling
* The ``with`` statement for context management (e.g. closing file handles)
* The increment/decrement operators, use ``count = count + 1`` not ``count += 1``
* List comprehensions, generator expressions, generator functions (just use for loops)

Also note that the examples should try to run under both Python 2.6, 2.7
and 3.3 (or later) without changes. i.e. The same versions of Python which
are supported by Biopython.

To this end, only simple print statements are used as ``print(some_string)``
which will work on both Python 2 and 3, with or without using
``from __future__ import print_function``.

Additionally, basic automated testing is done on TravisCI via the special
``.travis.yml`` file, test results here:
